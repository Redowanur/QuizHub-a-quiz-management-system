# QuizHub-a-quiz-management-system
During Covid-19, a lot of schools had started doing online classes. Even exams were held online. So we are trying to make an online based exam management system suitable for both the teacher and the student.
There will be three panels: Teacher,Student amd Admin.
The students will be able to see when their exam will be held, obtained numbers on different subject.
The teacher will be able to create questions, check attendance of each student, mark their exam papers and make final tabulation according to their score.
Admins will protect the privacy of both teacher and student panels, keep record of both.
